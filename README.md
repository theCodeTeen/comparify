## Backstory

Being an Indian, before buying anything: we surf multiple websites, checkout prices, spend hours and then purchase from the site which offers us lowest price!
This is an repeatative cycle whenever buying anything! So why not automate it? Hence we created comparify!

We even store user traffic and behaviour and can even show paid advertisements on our home page to generate revenues.
